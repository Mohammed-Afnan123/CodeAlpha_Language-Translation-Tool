# CodeAlpha Task 1_Language-Translation-Tool
This project is a simple and interactive Language Translator Web Application 🌍 built using Python, Streamlit, and Deep Translator 🐍⚙️. The main purpose of this project is to translate text from one language to another instantly ✨ with a clean, user-friendly interface 🖥️. Streamlit is used to develop the web app, allowing smooth interaction without needing any complex web development skills like HTML or JavaScript 🚀. Users can enter any text, select the target language from a list 🌐, and get the translated output within seconds ⚡. This project is beginner-friendly and a great introduction to building AI-based applications 🤖 while learning Python for real-world use. Future improvements can include features like automatic language detection 🎯, speech support 🔊, and document translation 📄. This project is part of my learning journey 📚 and internship tasks 📝 to gain strong knowledge in Artificial Intelligence and software development.

🚀 How to Run
